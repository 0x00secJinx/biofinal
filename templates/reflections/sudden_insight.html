            <h2><center>Explaination:</center></h2>
            <p>
                   My sudden insight happened with the RNA Replication Activity. This activity was a simulation of transcribtion and
               translation of DNA and RNA. We had sequences of DNA on the wall and we were in groups and competing
               with my entire class to be the first group to get the sentences. The different codons were on index cards with a
               word on the opposite side and these cards were taped to the wall on one side. After we copied the DNA sequences down,
               we had to transcribe them to the mRNA (messenger) sequence. All the A's match with the U's and the T's to A's,
               the G's to C's and the C's to G's. Then, we transcribed it to the tRNA sequence using the same method. After we had
               the tRNA sequence, we used the index cards to create a sentence. In the picture, you can see on sequence 2 that we
               had a 'mutation' in the transcribtion where we copied a base down wrong which led to an incorrect sentence.
            </p>
            <p>
               I chose this artifact as my sudden insight because it showed me a similar process as to how DNA is replicated inside the
               body. It also showed me how easy it is for a mutation to occur and how meticulous it is; With only one letter off, the "sentence"
               doesn't make sense. I had read in my textbook how the trancription method works, but I could not understand the terminology used
               in the book, but this activity really showed me how it works, hands on.
