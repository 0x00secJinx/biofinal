        	<h2>Evolution:</h2>
        	<p>
            Evolution is the overriding theme in biology. We see this with many aspects in biology with the
            idea of a common ancestor and many other cases of allelic frequency flips. Evolution is the change
            in allele frequency in a population which occurs over hundreds to thousands of years.
            An important note is that evolution does not say that humans come from monkeys, which is a main point in the debate over evolution.
            <br />
            One example of evolution that was given during this class was the case of the sticklebacks fish.
            They have a trait for a spine on the bottom of their body, with the spine being the dominant trait and no spine is the recessive.
            In the ocean, this spine helps them survive by preventing them from being eaten, but when some migrated to freshwater lakes, the spine game them a reproductive disadvantage.
            This reproductive disadvantage, where a dragonfly nymph can grab their spine and eat them, caused a shift in the allele frequency where more fish in te freshwater do not have spines.
            This new population in the lake is not a new species, but the population evolved to fit their environment easier.
            <br />
            Another example of evolution is endosymbiosis. The mitochondria and chloroplasts are both baterial-like as in they have their own DNA, and can perform mitosis. It is believed that
            they used to be their own entities. At one point, a larger cell engulfed the mitochondria, but did not consume it for nutrients. Instead, the two cells began a symbiotic relationship.
            This also shows that because our cells have mitochondria, that we have a common ancestor with every living thing on this planet.
          </p>

        	<h2>Biology Debate:</h2>
        	<p>
            Many of the medical advances and medical technologies come from biology. If we did not have biology, many people would not
            have the neccessary medical treatments that help them get better and heal. From everything from biochemistry to biotech,
            advances are being made daily that will help improve our quality of life. These advancements help us understand the natural
            world around us and could help improve our environment, and teach us how to respect the natural flow of life. The study of biology
            also is a humbling topic as we realize that humans are not the center of life. Many creatures and organisms are important to us in
            our daily lifes and our evolution. For example, much of the food we eat are helped digest by E. Coli living in our guts. These organisms
            were here long before humans and they help us digest food. These relationships between organisms are also part of the study of biology.
            Symbiotic relationships are a necessity for life and they can also explain some theories of evolution. The mitochondria that make our
            ATP and chloroplasts that are in plants are in a symbiotic relationship with the cells. The mitochondria have their own DNA and can replicate
            themselves so the theory of endosymbiosis states that the mitochondria were consumed by the cells and the the cell used them to get energy
            for it's processes. Without all this knowledge, we could not be where we are today with the technology we have, and the knowledge of the body
            and the processes in it.

        	<h2>Health and Body:</h2>
        	<p>
            This course has given me a great understanding of how much my body does, when I don't think I am doing anything. There are so many processes
            going on at one time that I would have never known about before this class. For example, my body is constantly raising and lowering my temperature
            to try to have the perfect temperature for survival. This course has taught me how I get my energy from the food I eat, to fighting off pathogens and
            has shown me some ways to help make my body's job easier. For example, I know now that I need to avoid really hot objects even if for a short period, such
            as a hot tub, or I risk denaturing some important enzyme in my body. From biochemistry, I now know that carbohydrates give me quick short-term energy, while
            lipids give long-term, slow-releasing energy and I can change my diet based on my needs for a certain period of time. In this course, we studied the immune
            system, so I now know what exactly is happening when I am sick and can take steps to help increase the recovery time. This course, mainly biochemistry, has
            helped me begin to get my health back on track as I am not the healthiest person ever, as it showed me how much care the body needs and if it doesn't get that,
            how fragile it is. The body is a complex thing with many things going on at a single point in time and biology has shown me the beauty and perfection nature has
            made inside of all of us.
