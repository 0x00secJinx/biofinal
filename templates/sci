stablizing - average
directional - one extreme is favored
disruptive - two extremes are favored; average is selected out

speciation
	alpatrick - separated by geography
	sympatrick - separated by reproduction problems
		(pre/post-zygotic problems)

Gene Flow/Genetic Drift
	bottleneck - catastrophic thing (few survive/lucky ones)
	founder's effect - the few surving start the next generation and the new population

	gene flow - migration (Europeans in the Americas)

Mutations

adaptive radiation - Finchs

Isolation leads to speciation
